## Starting Out: My Tech Journey Begins

In 2019, I began my software engineering journey at an insurance company in Centurion, Pretoria. It was one of the best starts I could’ve asked for — a place where mentorship was real, learning was encouraged, and the energy felt exciting. As a young developer fresh into the industry, I was surrounded by people who genuinely cared about helping me grow. I threw myself into the work, grateful for the opportunities and trusting that the system would reward good performance.

And in some ways, it did. Over the course of about 30 months, I consistently received strong salary increases — sometimes as high as 15% annually. At the time, this felt like a sign that I was doing well, and I had no reason to expect more. Or so I thought.

## The Salary Curve — and the Bonus Blindspot

Then, one day at the office, things changed. People were being called into meeting rooms. There was a subtle buzz, a shift in atmosphere. It didn’t take long before whispers started making their way around. Eventually, through the grapevine — not a manager, not HR, not official communication — I discovered that some colleagues were getting bonuses.

This was news to me. Up until that point, bonuses had never been mentioned in any of my performance reviews, team meetings, or casual conversations with leadership. They simply weren’t part of the conversation — or at least, not the one I was included in.

That’s when it hit me: I had no idea what I didn’t know. I wasn’t angry that I didn’t get a bonus — I was frustrated that I didn’t even know it was something I could get. This experience taught me something fundamental about the tech industry, especially in South Africa: when information about compensation is not shared — either by leadership or among peers — inequality creeps in quietly. And silence is its best friend.

## A Culture of Openness

After leaving that company and moving through a few roles, I now find myself at an investment bank in Sandton. One of the things I immediately noticed — and appreciated — was how open the company is about salary and bonus discussions. Whether you're a graduate, an intern, or part of senior leadership, everyone knows about the S&B (salary and bonus) structure. There’s even talk about share options and how they’re allocated.

That level of transparency builds trust. It makes you feel like you're part of something fair, something structured. You’re not guessing or hoping — you’re planning. You’re working toward goals that are clearly defined and fairly rewarded. Compared to my first role, where these conversations felt like secret handshakes behind closed doors, this openness is a breath of fresh air.

## But Still… Another Ceiling?

Yet even here, in a more transparent environment, I’ve noticed something else: silence still exists. Not from leadership this time — but from us, the employees. We don’t always talk to each other about our goals, our compensation, or whether we feel things are fair. And when we don’t communicate, we leave room for assumptions, disappointment, and quiet resentment to grow.

What I’ve learned is this: even in open cultures, silence can still create invisible ceilings. If you don’t know how your peers are progressing, or what opportunities they’re chasing, it becomes harder to advocate for yourself. The system may be better, but it still requires you to participate actively in your own success.

## Contracting With Your Manager

One of the best practices I’ve picked up recently is the idea of _contracting_ with your manager. It’s about creating alignment — being clear about your role, responsibilities, growth areas, and performance expectations. You don’t want to find out at the end of the year that your goals didn’t match what your manager had in mind.

Alongside that, getting regular feedback — not just annual reviews — is key. It gives you time to adjust, course correct, and show growth _before_ compensation decisions are made. And when those S&B discussions come around, it’s important to be ready. If you’re not willing to walk away, you’re not negotiating — you’re pleading. Know your value, state your case, and be clear about what you’re asking for.

## Final Thoughts

My journey through the South African tech industry has been shaped as much by what was said as by what wasn’t. From being completely in the dark about bonuses to working in a space where transparency is the norm, I’ve seen both sides of the compensation culture.

If I could encourage one thing, it would be this: let’s talk more. Let’s talk about money, bonuses, roles, and growth. Let’s help each other navigate these waters instead of letting companies control the narrative by default. Because when we communicate — openly, honestly, and without shame — we lift each other up. And when we stay silent, the cost is rarely just our own.
