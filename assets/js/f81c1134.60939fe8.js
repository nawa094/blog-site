It was one of the best starts I could\u2019ve asked for \u2014 a place where mentorship was real, learning was encouraged, and the energy felt exciting. As a young developer fresh into the industry, I was surrounded by people who genuinely cared about helping me grow. I threw myself into the work, grateful for the opportunities and trusting that the system would reward good performance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAnd in some ways, it did. Over the course of about 30 months, I consistently received strong salary increases \u2014 sometimes as high as 15% annually. At the time, this felt like a sign that I was doing well, and I had no reason to expect more. Or so I thought.\\n\\n## The Salary Curve \u2014 and the Bonus Blindspot\\n\\nThen, one day at the office, things changed. People were being called into meeting rooms. There was a subtle buzz, a shift in atmosphere. It didn\u2019t take long before whispers started making their way around. Eventually, through the grapevine \u2014 not a manager, not HR, not official communication \u2014 I discovered that some colleagues were getting bonuses.\\n\\nThis was news to me. Up until that point, bonuses had never been mentioned in any of my performance reviews, team meetings, or casual conversations with leadership. They simply weren\u2019t part of the conversation \u2014 or at least, not the one I was included in.\\n\\nThat\u2019s when it hit me: I had no idea what I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t angry that I didn\u2019t get a bonus \u2014 I was frustrated that I didn\u2019t even know it was something I could get. This experience taught me something fundamental about the tech industry, especially in South Africa: when information about compensation is not shared \u2014 either by leadership or among peers \u2014 inequality creeps in quietly. And silence is its best friend.\\n\\n## A Culture of Openness\\n\\nAfter leaving that company and moving through a few roles, I now find myself at an investment bank in Sandton. One of the things I immediately noticed \u2014 and appreciated \u2014 was how open the company is about salary and bonus discussions. Whether you\'re a graduate, an intern, or part of senior leadership, everyone knows about the S&B (salary and bonus) structure. There\u2019s even talk about share options and how they\u2019re allocated.\\n\\nThat level of transparency builds trust. It makes you feel like you\'re part of something fair, something structured. You\u2019re not guessing or hoping \u2014 you\u2019re planning. You\u2019re working toward goals that are clearly defined and fairly rewarded. Compared to my first role, where these conversations felt like secret handshakes behind closed doors, this openness is a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n## But Still\u2026 Another Ceiling?\\n\\nYet even here, in a more transparent environment, I\u2019ve noticed something else: silence still exists. Not from leadership this time \u2014 but from us, the employees. We don\u2019t always talk to each other about our goals, our compensation, or whether we feel things are fair. And when we don\u2019t communicate, we leave room for assumptions, disappointment, and quiet resentment to grow.\\n\\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is this: even in open cultures, silence can still create invisible ceilings. If you don\u2019t know how your peers are progressing, or what opportunities they\u2019re chasing, it becomes harder to advocate for yourself. The system may be better, but it still requires you to participate actively in your own success.\\n\\n## Contracting With Your Manager\\n\\nOne of the best practices I\u2019ve picked up recently is the idea of _contracting_ with your manager. It\u2019s about creating alignment \u2014 being clear about your role, responsibilities, growth areas, and performance expectations. You don\u2019t want to find out at the end of the year that your goals didn\u2019t match what your manager had in mind.\\n\\nAlongside that, getting regular feedback \u2014 not just annual reviews \u2014 is key. It gives you time to adjust, course correct, and show growth _before_ compensation decisions are made. And when those S&B discussions come around, it\u2019s important to be ready. If you\u2019re not willing to walk away, you\u2019re not negotiating \u2014 you\u2019re pleading. Know your value, state your case, and be clear about what you\u2019re asking for.\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nMy journey through the South African tech industry has been shaped as much by what was said as by what wasn\u2019t. From being completely in the dark about bonuses to working in a space where transparency is the norm, I\u2019ve seen both sides of the compensation culture.\\n\\nIf I could encourage one thing, it would be this: let\u2019s talk more. Let\u2019s talk about money, bonuses, roles, and growth. Let\u2019s help each other navigate these waters instead of letting companies control the narrative by default. Because when we communicate \u2014 openly, honestly, and without shame \u2014 we lift each other up. And when we stay silent, the cost is rarely just our own."},{"id":"/2025/06/15/setting-up-docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/06/15/setting-up-docusaurus","editUrl":"https://github.com/nawa094/nawa094.github.io/blog/2025-06-15-setting-up-docusaurus.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-15-setting-up-docusaurus.md","title":"Setting Up My Docusaurus Blog: Lessons Learned","description":"From AI assistance to manual debugging - my journey configuring Docusaurus with GitHub Pages","date":"2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Posts about Docusaurus configuration and customization"},{"inline":false,"label":"GitHub Pages","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/github-pages","description":"Deployment guides and troubleshooting for GitHub Pages"},{"inline":false,"label":"Web Development","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/webdev","description":"General web development concepts and tools"},{"inline":false,"label":"Documentation","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/documentation","description":"Technical writing and docs-as-code approaches"},{"inline":false,"label":"Troubleshooting","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/troubleshooting","description":"Debugging stories and solution guides"}],"readingTime":1.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Nawa Mumbwe","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nawam/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/nawam"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nawam/","github":"https://github.com/nawa094"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/nawa094.png","key":"nawam"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Setting Up My Docusaurus Blog: Lessons Learned","authors":"nawam","date":"2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","description":"From AI assistance to manual debugging - my journey configuring Docusaurus with GitHub Pages","sidebar_position":3,"tags":["docusaurus","github-pages","webdev","documentation","troubleshooting"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Cost of Silence: Lessons from the South African Tech Industry","permalink":"/blog/2025/06/21/money-talks"}},"content":"## The Promise of AI Assistance\\n\\nWhen I began this project, I thought: _\\"This will be easy - I\'ll just use DeepSeek R1 to generate the configs and be done in minutes.\\"_ The initial setup looked promising:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-docusaurus@latest my-blog classic --typescript\\n```\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nBut reality had other plans...\\n\\n## The Configuration Hurdles\\n\\n### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment Woes\\n\\nThe first version of my `deploy.yml` failed with frustrating permissions errors:\\n\\n```yaml\\n# First attempt (failed)\\n- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\\n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\\n  with:\\n    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\\n```\\n\\nAfter consulting the [Docusaurus deployment docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment), I fixed it by adding:\\n\\n```yaml {3-4}\\n# Working version\\npermissions:\\n  contents: write # Critical for gh-pages branch\\n  pages: write\\n```\\n\\n### 2. The Mysterious 404\\n\\nEven after successful builds, my site showed only the repository README. The solution?
